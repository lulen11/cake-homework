Hi Pedro, Hi Roger, Hi Nick 👋🏼

This is a homework interview task provided by Cake Equity for their open Frontend Developer role 💫

This app is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Take a looky

To run this project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 🎉

Or head to [https://cake-homework.vercel.app/](https://cake-homework.vercel.app/) to view the deployed version from `main`. 🎉 For reference, I used Vercel to quickly get you a link for review.
